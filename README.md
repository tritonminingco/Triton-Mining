# 🌊 Triton Mining Co. – Open Source Innovation Beneath the Surface

---

## 🧭 WHY

We believe the deep sea should not be exploited behind closed doors.

Today, critical mineral exploration is dominated by secrecy, ecological destruction, and extractive interests. But the ocean is humanity’s final frontier—and it deserves transparency, collaboration, and care.

**Triton Mining Co. exists to unlock deep-sea exploration through open-source technology, ethical autonomy, and global cooperation.**

We’re building tools that allow anyone—scientists, developers, explorers—to contribute to sustainable seabed research and resource recovery.

---

## ⚙️ HOW

We use open-source software, autonomous robotics, and real-time ocean data to build modular systems that:

- **Map the seabed** using sonar, LiDAR, and AI-based detection.
- **Operate AUVs/ROVs** with AI-powered navigation, collision avoidance, and mission control.
- **Monitor ocean health** in real time via marine sensors, dashboards, and alerts.
- **Simulate mining environments** before ever touching the seafloor.
- **Comply with ISA regulations** through automated reporting and traceable transparency.

We collaborate in public, publish our research, and welcome contributors worldwide.
